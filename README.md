# Sunflower 
https://github.com/Sunflower-Project
## Description
Sunflower is an up-cycling application built with the goal of fostering a community of individuals to reuse and create works of art out of discarded items, or at the very least find new ways to upgrade their existing ones.
- e.g. Taking a faded and worn down table and finding someone else who stained and cleaned up a table similar to yours, making it like-new again.

## Brief Example 
Here is an example of a "recycle" item. You can see it is in poor condition and below is a suggested item to model its "upcycle" after.
